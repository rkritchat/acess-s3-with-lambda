# acess-s3-with-lambda
The example for upload file / download file from AWS-S3 via AWS-Lambda trigger by API-Gateway

AWS - Technology
  - AWS-S3
  - AWS-Lambda
  - AWS-API-Gateway
  - AWS-CloudWatch

PS.
To make it's working perfectly, need to add the all media type under "Binary Media Types" of AWS-API-Gateway.
